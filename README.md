# Getting Started with Nodejs, Reactjs, Bootstrap
This project was bootstrapped with [NPM Init](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-init), [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and Design with [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
Install package.
### `npm run build`
Install package to the `frontend` folder and builds the app \
for production to the `frontend/build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes \
the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in your browser.

## Config
App default run at port 8080.\
Config it by adding the environment variable Port to your \
env file similar to my .env.example file.
